2. Get properties of your Azure account/Service Principal.
    ```
    Before you can provision and access a Kubernetes cluster on Azure, you need to add the account credentials in Gardener. 
    Gardener needs the credentials to provision and operate the Azure infrastructure for your Kubernetes cluster.

    **Ensure that the account has the `contributor` role.**
    ```


    -  Tenant ID
    
        The TenantID is also called DirectoryID - https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Properties.

    - Client Secret
        Secrets for the Azure Account/Service Principal can be genereted/rotated via the Azure Portal.
        Access the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the `Active Directory` service.
        Within the service navigate to `App registrations` and select your service principal. 
        In the detail view navigate to `Certificates & secrets`. In the section, you can generate a new secret for the Service Principal.

3. On the Gardener dashboard, choose *Secrets* and then the plus sign <img src="images/plus_icon.jpg"> in the Azure frame to add a new Azure secret.

    Copy "Key Value" from the email into "Client Secret".
